My [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com) solutions.

My goal was to finish each day in a different language, although I
don't know if I'll go through with that.  I did make a list of 46
languages I had at least written a trivial program in before that
would be usable for solving problems.

## Requirements

 - bats, prove for testing
 - day 1: Common Lisp: sbcl and buildapp
 - day 2: JavaScripts: node.js
 - day 3: GNU APL
 - day 4: ruby 2.x
 - day 5: Java
 - day 6: [J 8](http://jsoftware.com)
 - day 7: perl 5
 - day 8: C: any reasonable C compiler
 - day 9: Modula 3: [cm3](https://modula3.elegosoft.com/cm3/)
